 Seems like you need an NSOperationQueue then you can add NSBlockOperationWithBlock for each task. You can also specify that a given block is dependent on another block. You don't have to call start. It just happens.  So, again, construct your NSOperationBlocks with the tasks you wish to run. Then, add then to an NSOperationQueue. If you want specify dependendencies.

 NSOperationQueue *operationQueue = [NSOperationQueue new];
 NSBlockOperation *blockCompletionOperation = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock:^{
